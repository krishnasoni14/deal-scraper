# Deals Scraper

The options to scrape data are `code/front-end` and `code/back-end`: 

The file `front-end-scrape-main.js` inside the `code/front-end` folder goes through each daily deals page and scrapes data from the DOM. It gets limited data about all 1000 deals. 

The file `back-end-scrape-main.js` inside the `code/back-end` folder mimics Amazon's API calls. It gets more detailed data about only 300 deals.

The `links-only.js` files scrape only the links of the daily deals. There are two options, front-end and back-end. The links are then available in an array.

- Open up the console
- Copy and paste the code into the console

The `code/miscellaneous` folder contains two files:
- `miscellaneous.js` contains random code created during the process of doing this project
- `r-script-for-descriptive-stats.R` contains R code to gather descriptive statistics about the scraped data
